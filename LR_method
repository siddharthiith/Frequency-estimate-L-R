\begin{frame}{Actual approximation part of L and R technique}
Our primary aim was to implement L and R technique of frequency offset estimation.
\bigbreak
There are 2 parts in it, one using estimate and other as exact.
\bigbreak
Estimated part:
\bigbreak
$\Delta\hat{f}\widetilde{=} \frac{1}{\pi T_s(M+1)}arg(\sum_{k=1}^{M}R(k)) $
\bigbreak
This is true for small frequency offset , as what we observed , it is true until 800 Hz frequency offset.
\bigbreak
Condition on $\Delta\hat{f}$ :$ T_s$ must be grater than or equal to 1/2*$\Delta{f}$
\bigbreak
Condition on M: M*$\Delta{f}$*$ T_s$ $<<$ 1.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Calculation of R(k)}
R(k) is the auto correlation of our received signal r(k),which is complex oscillation with added gaussian noise.
\bigbreak
$R(k) \overset{\Delta}{=} \frac{1}{N-k}\sum_{i=k+1}^{N} r_{i}r^{*}_{i-k}$
 , $1 \leq k \leq N-1$
 \bigbreak
 N $=$ length of signal r(k) i.e. received signal.
 \bigbreak
 The above expression is the auto correlation of received digital signal.

\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
But because of the drawback that the frequency offset should be small (as what we observed , should be upto 800 Hz), we implemented the exact part for frequency offset estimation.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Exact part}
For large frequency offset , above estimation goes wrong.So we use the following.
\bigbreak
Exact part:
\bigbreak
$\Delta\hat{f}\widetilde{=} \frac{1}{2\pi T_s}\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{M}Im(R(k))}{\sum_{k=1}^{M}kRe(R(k))} $
\bigbreak
Constraints on M is same as previous.
\bigbreak
This yields a better approximation even for frequency offset as large as 40 MHz.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Practical values of the parameters used}
Signal Length N = 36
\bigbreak
frequency offset \Delta{f} =5MHz 
\bigbreak
Ts = 1e-9 .
\bigbreak
Fc = 25 GHz. (central frequency)
\bigbreak
But Fc isn't required anywhere in code.
\bigbreak
$M = \frac{N}{2} =18$
\bigbreak
%The Ts we took is = $10^{-9}$
\end{frame}

 \begin{frame}{Error for SNR = 5 units}
 Here, the frequency offset, $delta_f$, is varying from 0.1 to 40 MHz.
     \begin{figure}
         \centering
         \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{fixed_SNR5.png}
         \label{fig:my_label}
     \end{figure}
    \bigbreak
    Clearly, the error for our destined frequency offset, 5 MHz, is very low.
 \end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Error vs SNR for high frequency offsets/ practical offset}
Here, frequency offset is fixed to be 5 MHz.
\bigbreak
    \begin{figure}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{error_vs_snr.png}
        \label{fig:my_label}
    \end{figure}

\bigbreak
We can clearly see that the error is very very low for high SNR.
